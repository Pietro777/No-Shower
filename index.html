						Christmas day, a foreign holiday, never give too much attention, the streets everywhere flower green festival decoration, far near near the blessings like snow, still let oneself infection, the mood also subsequently and move. Christmas Eve is the time for the night, the peaceful night, the sounds of the night, the revelry in every corner of the world. But more like the meaning of peace, peace two words, how many people's life hope; Peace wishes, always warm to each of us, think of what is more expensive than that in the world

								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas Eve, the dinner outside, returned home to the sky has fallen thick curtain. Holding a cup of hot coffee, leaning on the balcony, silent. Coffee, dare not to drink at night, once let me good to sleep of it did not know when have become oneself insomnia the culprit, is old? Perhaps. Tonight, I want to make an exception. </p>
								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The aroma of coffee filled the air, and it was a long thought. The evening breeze slowly, send the joyful atmosphere not far away. The community clubhouse is holding a Christmas party, and the colorful lights of the rainbow are shining brightly. I don't want to be able to fit into that noisy jubilation, but I look at it and feel good.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no moon tonight, the sky is full of stars, think, a star is a pair of eyes, or far or near, silent gaze, full of care and blessing, is not? The stars are so small under the scintillating sky that they are so small. Actually, the heart always wants to knock is this simple happiness? Still savour the aroma of the cup, waiting for the ringing bells of Christmas Eve, peaceful and peaceful. In the pocket, the sound of "didi", the mobile phone's information sound, a look, the cold warning signal warmth prompt, tomorrow cold air coming.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow, it will soon be tomorrow, the same morning light that rises, may be caught in the cold of the wind and rain, but the heart with this part of warmth, and how to be afraid of cold and frozen</p>
