The sincerity of her (him) touched me, and the sincerity of her (him) touched me, and her (his) sincerity infected me. Therefore, I will give you such a blessing to you, I do not know, but I think the truth must be a warm red leaf. I wish you a speedy recovery and return to the home. There is a Santa Claus blessing, there is a Santa Claus tie, there is a prayer, I think, you can hear, can feel. You'll be back soon. Hear the tinkle of bells? That is the voice of blessing and prayer. And the sound of missing, so you must come back early.

I would like to send such a blessing to my parents who are far away. I hope you will be healthy and happy. In such a cold season, I hope your daughter's blessing can bring you some warmth. Maybe I am not a good girl, but my blessing is sincere. I want to say to you, &quot;dad, mom, my daughter has been bothering you all the time. It's your daughter's unfilial piety. I think I should grow up, my daughter is not good at words. Only bless you, I hope you are happy!&quot;
